# Writing Test Cases - 1

It is compulsory for a test case to contain the following files
* answer.txt
* prepend.txt
* append.txt
* input.txt
* output.txt
* testcase.json

If your test case's input and output is generated by a program/script, it's conventional to put the source code inside a folder called `__generate`
